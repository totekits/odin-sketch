## Steps
1. Create a webpage with a 16*16 grid of square divs
2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them
3. Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid
4. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before
